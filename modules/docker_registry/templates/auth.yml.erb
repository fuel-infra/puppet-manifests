# ACL specifies who can do what. If the match section of an entry matches the
# request, the set of actions will be compared and token will be issued if
# all the requested actions are allowed by the entry.
#  * It is possible to match on user's name ("account"), subject type ("type")
#    and name ("name"; for type=repository which, at the timeof writing, is the
#    only known subject type, this is the image name).
#  * Matches are evaluated as shell file name patterns ("globs") by default,
#    so "foobar", "f??bar", "f*bar" are all valid. For even more flexibility
#    match patterns can be evaluated as regexes by enclosing them in //, e.g.
#    "/(foo|bar)/".
#  * ACL is evaluated in the order it is defined until a match is found.
#  * Empty match clause matches anything, it only makes sense at the end of the
#    list and can be used as a way of specifying default permissions.
#  * Empty actions set means "deny everything", special set consisting of a
#    single "*" action means "allow everything".
#  * If no match is found the default is to deny the request.
